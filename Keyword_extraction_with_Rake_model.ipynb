            "Hotz founded his AI startup, comma.ai, in September 2015.[45] In an interview with Bloomberg, Hotz revealed that the company was building vehicular automation technology based on machine learning algorithms. Hotz built a working self-driving 2016 Acura ILX, which he demonstrated on the I-280 in a video,[4] resulting in a cease and desist letter from the California Department of Motor Vehicles.[46]  Hotz wanted to sell his technology to Tesla Motors, meeting with CEO Elon Musk.[47][48] Hotz claims that Musk offered him $12 million (minus $1 million for every month it took Hotz to work on the task) to create a driving system that could replace the MobilEye solution that Tesla used at the time.[49] Tesla later released a statement on their website citing corrections to the Bloomberg article, stressing that their autopilot system was developed in-house, with a vision chip component from MobilEye, instead of one separate autopilot system manufactured by MobilEye, as suggested by Bloomberg reporter Ashlee Vance.[47] Musk offered advice on Hotz's self-driving car project in a December 2015 interview.[50]  On October 27, 2016, the NHTSA informed Hotz that the product was legally required to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and requested information that would confirm such compliance.[51] A day later, George Hotz tweeted from Shenzhen that the comma one was cancelled.[52][53][non-primary source needed] Kristen Lee stated on Jalopnik that the NHTSA was simply trying to open a dialog, and commented: \"Instead, they got the worst attitude possible from Silicon Valley: try and regulate us, thought leaders, and weâ€™ll take our ball and go home.\"[54]  comma.ai open sourced their self driving car software (called openpilot) on November 30, 2016, emphasizing its intended use for research without a warranty.[55][56]\n"
